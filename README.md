Hello, Welcome to my Github Profile.

I am a budding Javascript developer and passionate about learning and writing code. I chose to be a Javascript developer because I wanted to become a Java developer I couldn't do it. 
I had started my journey in scrimba.com to learn everything from scratch to become a software developer.
